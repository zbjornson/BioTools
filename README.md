Mathematica tools for biology

R has BioConductor, Python has BioPython, MatLab has various packages, Perl has BioPerl. Mathematica has no community-supported biology packages, despite having fanstatic analysis and graphics capabilities (among other things) that can make great visualizations for biology.

Work in progress. Contributions welcome.
